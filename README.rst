Custom unit guidelines
----------------------

A lot of these are due to limitations in our converter, so these are
subject to change.

* No clantech yet.
* See here for a full list of available weapons: https://github.com/gtaylor/btmux_template_io/blob/master/btmux_template_io/item_table.py
* No split crits.
* No quads.
* Tech level isn't important. 
* **Make sure you pick Inner Sphere for Techbase**. Mixed and Clan techbases are both not accepted right now.
* The site is Solaris themed, so it's perfectly fine if your units are quirky or odd
